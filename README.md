RealTime Voice Translation with LLM Integration

## Description
Real-Time Voice Translation with LLM Integration is an AI-powered application that captures speech from a user in one language, translates it into a target language in real-time using Large Language Models (LLMs), and outputs the translated speech. This system combines the power of speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech synthesis, making cross-language communication seamless and intuitive.
